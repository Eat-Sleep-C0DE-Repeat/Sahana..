India Coronavirus Cases: Results of two different serological surveys, one in Delhi and the other in Mumbai, were announced on Tuesday. Both the surveys found the presence of novel Coronavirus-specific antibodies in slightly less than 25 per cent of those tested. This could mean that in either of these cities, there were chances that about 25 per cent of the cityâ€™s population had already been infected by the virus, if we assume that the disease was uniformly spread in the population.
