Serological tests, that look for disease-specific antibodies in an individual, are carried out to estimate the spread of the disease in a population group. Since it is not possible to do a diagnostic test on everyone, the real number of people infected by the disease is not known, especially since most of the patients are known to be asymptomatic. Health authorities therefore depend on serological tests to estimate this number.
